JustDeploy is an open-source application designed to simplify the deployment process for developers. It allows you to deploy your applications on your own server. JustDeploy handles server connection, Docker installation, and secure certificate generation, making the deployment process seamless and efficient. JustDeploy read your app source (.env, Dockfile, docker-compose) and allow you to deploy it.

## How JustDeploy work

This CLI tool is designed to be installed directly on the developerâ€™s computer, not on the deployment server. It connects remotely to the server via the Docker socket, allowing container management and deployment orchestration from the local machine. This eliminates the need for server-side installation, streamlining integration with remote environments and ensuring smooth interaction between the developer's machine and the server.

JustDeploy is that it **doesn't install anything on your server other than your application.** This makes it an ideal choice for small servers with limited resources or development environments

## Features

- Connects to your server
- Installs Docker
- Deploys your application from Dockerfile
- Create tls certificates with let's encrypt
- Create git hooks to deploy on every commit
- Deploy and connect database from docker-compose

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.justdeploy.app | bash
```

## Usage

To create a new deployment you must run the justdeploy command at the bottom of your project where your dockerfile is.

```bash
justdeploy
```

JustDeploy will create a `./justdeploy` folder at the root of your project to be able to store the deployment information and the certificates that certify to communicate with the docker engine.

For now JustDeploy only support debian base VMs.

After running `justdeploy`, follow the prompts to connect to your server and deploy your application.

it should open your browser on this page.

In this step you can connect you server and when you click on the button JustDeploy install and setup everything he needs.

In this 2nd step you can configure your application with name and enable tls if you want.

You can see all the process on [this video.](https://youtu.be/u2nQGLpXTxM)

### Add Database

When you have deploy your app you can create and connect a database services from preconfigured services or your local docker-compose settings.

On the Deploy page click on on the databases services tab and create one from the modal.

Feel free to add more preconfigured services with `databases.go` by create a pull request.

### Prerequisites

- openssl
- ssh

Before deploying your application using JustDeploy, it is required that a domain name is associated with your server. This is a necessary step to generate the certificate, even if you disable
